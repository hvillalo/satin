\title{
Read ocean productivity data from Oregon State University files
}
\description{
Read, for a user defined area, net primary production data from hdf files downloaded from OSU's Ocean Productivity home page.
}
\usage{
read.osunpp(h5, lons, lats)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{h5}{ name of the hdf file(s) to be read.}
  \item{lons}{ a vector with western- and eastern-most longitudes. }
  \item{lats}{ a vector with southern- and northern-most  latitudes. }
}
\details{
This function reads Oregon State University ocean productivity data files (see \code{\link{dnpp}}).  However, downloaded files should be first converted from hdf version 4 to version 5 with h4h5tools (\url{https://support.hdfgroup.org/downloads/h4h5tools/h4h5tools_2_2_5.html}).  The user must specify the minimum and maximum latitude and longitude limits within the interval (-90,  90) and (-180, 180) respectively.  
}
\value{
 An object of class \code{"satin"}. See \code{\link{satin-class}} for details.
