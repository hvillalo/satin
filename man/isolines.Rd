\title{ Interpolate isolines from ocean data }
\description{
User defined isolines are interpolated from ocean data stored in a satin object and returned as polylines.
}
\usage{
isolines(X, levels, period = 1, depth = 1, plot = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X}{a satin object as returned by \code{\link{read.nasaoc}}, \code{\link{read.ghrsst}}, \code{\link{read.osunpp}}, or \code{\link{read.cmems}}. }
  \item{levels}{a vector of desired isolines in data units. }
  \item{period}{ an integer referring to the image number to process. }
  \item{depth}{ an integer referring to a depth level. Only for Copernicus data that includes variables at different depths. }
  \item{plot}{ logical, if \code{TRUE} a plot is produced (the default). }
}
\details{
Polyline coordinates of desired isolines are calculated via \code{contourLines} and \code{convCP} (from \pkg{PBSMapping} package).  Perhaps only interesting with sea surface temperatures (isotherms).  For smoother isolines, the function \code{\link{pixelate}} can be used to spatialy re-scale the data.  In order to use this function with Copernicus data returned from \code{\link{read.cmems}}, the appropriate indexing should be previously done.
}
\value{
A list with two data frames of class \code{"PolySet"} and \code{"PolyData"}. See \code{help(PolySet)} and \code{help(PolyData)} for a complete description.
